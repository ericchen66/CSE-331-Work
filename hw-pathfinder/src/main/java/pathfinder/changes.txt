Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder, and why you made those changes.

I made the GraphEdge and GraphNode classes non-static, as I want them to access the parameters of the outer
Graph class directly without requiring parameters of their own. Instead of throwing exceptions for
getNode and getEdge in my Graph, I returned null when the given parameter does not exist for a node/edge
in the Graph. This is because I wanted to avoid too many methods in other classes throwing exceptions
or using try/catch blocks, as more and more classes rely on Graph.
