# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# two paths between two nodes has the same cost

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 5.000 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 5.000 from A to D in simpleGraph
added edge 5.000 from C to B in simpleGraph
added edge 5.000 from D to B in simpleGraph

path from A to B:
A to C with weight 5.000
C to B with weight 5.000
total cost: 10.000
