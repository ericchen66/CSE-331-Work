## CSE 331 hw-graph Coding Questions

Briefly explain why you included the operations you did and why you feel they are a sufficient
interface to a graph. If your design includes multiple classes or interfaces, explain why you
included each one; if not, explain whether you considered additional classes and why you decided
not to include them.


I included the three classes that I did because in my mind, they form a hierarchical structure.
I did not know originally whether I should create a separate class for edges, but I realized that
their functionality is sufficiently different from nodes that they warrant their own class. The
top-level class in my design is the Graph class, which depends on the GraphNode and GraphEdge classes
to form a complete graph from multiple nodes/edges.
In the Graph class, I included the basic required commands to add a node or create an edge between
two nodes, but I also thought it would be useful for a client to be able to remove edges/nodes
if they no longer need them. Since unnecessary objects make operations more difficult for a client
and take up memory, I added methods for removal as well. Another method I decided to add to Graph
is path, which finds a path between two nodes of the graph, if possible, without any consideration
for finding the most efficient path, since I want greater flexibility in my design.

What was your testing strategy for this assignment? How do your script tests and JUnit tests
differ from each other (if they do), and why?
