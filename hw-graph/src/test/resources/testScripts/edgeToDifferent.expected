# Tests a parent node that has edges to two
# other nodes. Ensures parent/child relation holds
# for all nodes

# Creates an empty graph
created graph graph1

# Adds three nodes to the graph
added node node1 to graph1
added node node2 to graph1
added node node3 to graph1

# Creates two edges, both originating from the same node
# but connecting to two different nodes
added edge edge1 from node1 to node2 in graph1
added edge edge2 from node1 to node3 in graph1

# Lists the children of the parent node
the children of node1 in graph1 are: node2(edge1) node3(edge2)
