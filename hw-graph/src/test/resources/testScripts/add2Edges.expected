# Tests adding two edges from one node of a graph,
# ensuring the parent and child node are correct.
# Edges travel to same child

# Creates a graph
created graph graph1

# Adds two nodes to the graph
added node node1 to graph1
added node node2 to graph1

# Creates two edges between the two nodes
added edge edge1 from node1 to node2 in graph1
added edge edge2 from node1 to node2 in graph1

# Lists the children of parent node
the children of node1 in graph1 are: node2(edge1) node2(edge2)
